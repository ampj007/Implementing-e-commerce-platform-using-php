 Implementing e-commerce platform using php
============================================
An e-commerce platform has “SoldBySeller” and “BoughtByCustomer” tables. You need to run an audit process to compare these two tables and generate a report on discrepancies detected. Put your best effort to identify the list of columns in each table, reporting types/structures, highlighting mismatching columns etc. Can it Scale for Million Items in both tables ?
